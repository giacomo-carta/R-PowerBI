# R-PowerBI-Hollywood-Profits

Welcome to my project repository where I use R and PowerBI to uncover meaningful insights in the "Hollywood Most Profitable Stories" dataset.

## About the Dataset

The "Hollywood Most Profitable Stories" dataset contains information about 70 Hollywood movies. It offers a comprehensive view of their Title, Genre, Audience Score and Total Gross.

## Tools Used

- R
- PowerBI

## Project Overview

In this project, I employed R for to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the data set, and then I used PowerBI to create a meaningful dashboard to showcase trends.

## Repository Structure

- The file 'Hollywoods_Most_Profitable_Stories_Dataset.csv' contains the raw data that I imported in R.
- The 'Cleaned_Dataset.csv' is the refined version of the original dataset.
- The 'R_Project.R' file contains the functions that I used to perform the EDA, the Data Cleaning and to prepare the data to export it in Power BI.
- The 'PowerBI_R_Assignment.pbix' Includes the Power BI dashboard that I developed to showcase the data.
- The 'R_Script_for_PowerBI_Chart.txt' contains the R script that I used to create a unique chart in Power BI to meet my needs.

Feel free to explore the individual folders for detailed information on each phase of the project.
